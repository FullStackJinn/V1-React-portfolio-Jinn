                <p>
                    Hello and welcome to my website portfoio! As you can see I am a huge anime fan.
                    Other than watching and keeping up with latest animes; I like to code and play video games such as 
                    League of Legends. During the time working as a lead technician assemblying butterfly knife trainers to later solving web dev problems.
                    My interest grew and turned into a bottomless well. Combining this with my ability to learning
                    quickly and strong work ethic, I am looking for a company that I would be able to grow and learn from as well as
                    contribute my skills and perspectives.
